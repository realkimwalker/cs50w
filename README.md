### Description: Harvard's CS50w: This course picks up where CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, you'll learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By course's end, you'll emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower you to design and deploy applications on the Internet.

### CS50w covered the following:

#### HTML, CSS, Git, Python, Django, SQL, Models, and Migrations
#### JavaScript, ReactJS, User Interfaces, Testing, CI/CD
#### Scalability and Security

### Thank you for checking out my work in CS50w!
